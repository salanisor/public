This is a directory with individual READMEs for particular technologies.


First, make sure you have a Helm chart ready in your repository. For this example, let's assume the Helm chart is located in the `charts` directory within your repository.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can set up the GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Helm Chart Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build-and-push-chart:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Helm CLI
      uses: helm/helm-action@v2
      with:
        version: 'v3.10.2'

    - name: Bootstrap Helm (if needed)
      run: |
        if [ ! -d ~/.helm ]; then
          mkdir -p ~/.helm
          chown -R $GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNNER_USER:$GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNNER_GROUP ~/.helm
        fi

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        make install-dependencies  # Replace with your actual command to install any necessary dependencies

    - name: Build Helm Chart
      run: |
        helm package charts/my-chart  # Replace 'my-chart' with the actual chart directory name

    - name: Push Chart to Registry
      env:
        HELM_REGISTRY_USER: ${{ secrets.HELM_REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        HELM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.HELM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        HELM_REGISTRY_URL: "https://your-helm-registry-url"  # Replace with your actual Helm registry URL
      run: |
        helm registry login --username "${HELM_REGISTRY_USER}" --password "${HELM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD}" "${HELM_REGISTRY_URL}"
        helm push my-chart-${GITHUB_REF_NAME}.tgz ${HELM_REGISTRY_URL}/my-namespace/  # Replace 'my-namespace' with the desired namespace

    - name: Test Helm Chart (Optional)
      if: success() && needs.build-and-push-chart
      run: |
        helm install --dry-run --debug my-chart ./charts/my-chart  # Replace 'my-chart' and 'my-chart' as needed

```

### Explanation:
1. **Checkout Repository**: Uses the `actions/checkout@v3` action to clone your repository.
2. **Set up Helm CLI**: Uses the `helm/helm-action@v2` action to install Helm if it's not already available.
3. **Bootstrap Helm**: Ensures that the Helm directory is set up properly in the GitHub Actions runner.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Runs a command to install any necessary dependencies for building your chart (you can replace this with actual commands).
5. **Build Helm Chart**: Uses `helm package` to build and package your chart from the `charts/my-chart` directory.
6. **Push Chart to Registry**: Logs in to the Helm registry using credentials stored as secrets, then pushes the packaged chart.
7. **Test Helm Chart**: Optionally runs a test install of the chart to ensure it works as expected.

### Secrets:
Make sure you have created and secured the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository settings:
- `HELM_REGISTRY_USERNAME`: The username for your Helm registry.
- `HELM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: The password or token for your Helm registry.

Replace placeholders like `my-chart` and `https://your-helm-registry-url` with actual values relevant to your setup.
